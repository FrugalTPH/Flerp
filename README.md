2014 - A Freelance enterprise resource planning system. Basically a light-weight, desktop-based document & project management information system.  

Features: 

- Uses a local MongoDb as the database with a DevExpress Winforms GUI. 
- Acts as a database for Parties (People & Organisations), "Binders" (Admin, Work & Library folders), Documents (Input & Output), Issues and Emails. 
- Drag & drop file-managent / automation for the freelancer, inc. duplicate-checking, registering & assigning entities to binders.
- Auto-numbering of registered entities, with short human-readable/referencable short-id codes.
- Fast, one-click loading of binder content from the GUI.
- Crawls nominated email servers, hoovering up emails to be treated & registered as documents to relevant binders. 
- Basic classification of entities, and basic meta-data stored for each entity, including 3-state status tracking (Pending Release, Released, Cancelled).

The system was built as a functional prototype for my own purposes, to automate manual processes I'd used previously in Excel.
